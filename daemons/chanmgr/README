A daemon that only holds channels running, so comms, you connect to it start a channel or connect
to an existing channel and you can ask who is on the channel, broadcast on the channel, send
something to someone on the channel(for example ask some data provider to include you in the
receivers of some event).

This program will connect to the main manager's event notifier and create a channel based on that.
Further, this daemon is the main way to connect to programs in here.

It' socket will be named "chanmgr.sock" and will reside in the manager's directory. It's not placed
in it's directory so others can find it regardless of it's own location.
