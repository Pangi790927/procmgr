This is a process manager that is intended to isolate different processes from each-oter in order
to safeguard from crashes and stucks from different utils. This manager has also the duty to
schedule said processes.

This manager will:
    + allways be running (for example as a daemon)
    + have a config file
    + have a ctrl binary (itself)
    + start/stop processes (restart them when they crash)
    + have a library to connect with? (procmgr.h will suffice)
    - hold comm channels (a sub-daemon does this)
